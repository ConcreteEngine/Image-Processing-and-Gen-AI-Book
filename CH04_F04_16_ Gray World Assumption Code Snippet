# Compute the average color of each channel
avg_b = np.mean(b)
avg_g = np.mean(g)
avg_r = np.mean(r)

# Compute the average color overall
avg = (avg_b + avg_g + avg_r) / 3

# Scale each channel to make the average color gray
b = b * (avg / avg_b)
g = g * (avg / avg_g)
r = r * (avg / avg_r)

# Merge the channels back together
